# JobPosters

We discuss the presentation on Thursday. You should all take some role in the presentation. It should start off with a hook, typically a statement or question that motivates the app. Then an elevator pitch which describes the grand vision in a few well-rehearsed sentences. Then explain who the app is designed for and how they would use it when it is fully developed.  Finally give a tour of the current version of the app and talk about the next steps you would take if you continued to work on it.

## Hook

How do students get messages of job information on campus? 

## Purpose of JobPosters

Large amount of students would like to work on campus for various kinds of reasons like learning experience, teaching experience, financial support, and so on. JobPosters is a platform unique to Brandeis University. It aims to help faculties or staffs to find teaching assisstants, research assisstants, roosevelt Fellow, peer mentor, and so on. All students can get the messages sent by faculties easily including job description, job requirement, and salary. It is such an excellent platform for students to find jobs on campus.

## Future progress

I plan to create two versions of students and staffs so that only staff version has job posting function.
