# JobPosters

## Hook

How do students get messages of job information on campus? 

## Purpose of JobPosters

Large amount of students would like to work on campus for various kinds of reasons like learning experience, teaching experience, financial support, and so on. JobPosters is a platform unique to Brandeis University. It aims to help faculties or staffs to find teaching assisstants, research assisstants, roosevelt Fellow, peer mentor, and so on. All students can get the messages sent by faculties easily including job description, job requirement, and salary. It is such an excellent platform for students to find jobs on campus.

## Future progress

I plan to create two versions of students and staffs so that only staff version has job posting function.
